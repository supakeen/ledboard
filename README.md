# ledboard

ledboard shows things on HUB75-compatible panels through the use of a `ledcat`-compatible binary. You can find `ledcat`-compatible binaries in the [rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/) repositories examples, or you can take [polyfloyd's implementation](https://github.com/polyfloyd/ledcat).
